# 🎤 Lock Focus: Round 2 Presentation (Slide Content Only)

---

## Slide 1: Title Screen
**[Visual Outline]:** Hero Image of Lock Focus Dashboard with "Cognitive Load: Optimal" badge visible.
**[Bullet Points]:**
*   **Headline:** LOCK FOCUS — Adaptive Reading, Reimagined.
*   **Mission:** Building the world's first "Intent-Aware" cognitive interface.
*   **Status:** Fully functional proof-of-concept (Prototype Round 2).
*   **Core Tech:** React • TensorFlow.js • MediaPipe • Web Audio API.
*   **Tagline:** "Your Interface Should Adapt To You, Not The Other Way Around."
*   **Team:** [Your Team Name] - [Your Track/Category]

## Slide 2: The Silent Crisis (Problem)
**[Visual Outline]:** Split screen. Left: Wall of dense text. Right: User looking stressed/distracted.
**[Bullet Points]:**
*   **The Scale:** 1 in 5 people globally are neurodiverse (ADHD, Dyslexia, ASD).
*   **Cognitive Load:** Static layouts force users to "decode" text, draining working memory.
*   **The "Drift":** ADHD users lose focus every 12 seconds on average during passive reading.
*   **High Friction:** Diagnosis is expensive ($500+), and current tools require complex manual setup.
*   **The Result:** Lower comprehension, higher educational dropout rates, and workforce burnout.

## Slide 3: The Solution - "Lock Focus"
**[Visual Outline]:** Animated diagram: Camera -> AI Analysis -> UI Transformation.
**[Bullet Points]:**
*   **Real-Time Adaptation:** The interface changes *instantly* based on user behavior (scrolling/gaze).
*   **Intent Detection:** Uses webcam to track gaze, head position, and blink rate.
*   **Zero-Click Accessibility:** Support activates automatically—no menus to dig through.
*   **Privacy-First:** 100% Client-Side Processing (Edge AI). No data leaves the browser.
*   **Universal Design:** Helps everyone focus better, not just those with a diagnosis.

## Slide 4: Feature 1 - Neuro-Pilot (Technical USP)
**[Visual Outline]:** GIF of "Focus Flow" mode blurring text when looking away, then unblurring.
**[Bullet Points]:**
*   **Attention Gating:** Content blurs when gaze leaves the screen > 3 seconds.
*   **MediaPipe Integration:** Sub-millimeter Iris Tracking for precise gaze coordinates (X, Y).
*   **Audio Feedback:** Subtle binaural cues guide attention back gently (Gamma waves).
*   **Focus Metrics:** Tracks "Sustained Attention Span" to gamify progress over time.
*   **Use Case:** Ideal for long-form reading, exams, and deep work sessions.

## Slide 5: Feature 2 - PeriQuest & Reader (Accessibility)
**[Visual Outline]:** Split screen: PeriQuest Game gameplay vs. Adaptive Reader document view.
**[Bullet Points]:**
*   **PeriQuest (Vision Game):** Gamifies peripheral vision expansion—critical for Dyslexic readers.
*   **Adaptive Parsing:** Converts *any* PDF into a responsive, accessible HTML stream.
*   **Syllable Slasher:** Automates "Chunking" (breaking words: syl-la-ble) to aid decoding.
*   **Custom Environments:** "Dyslexia Mode" (OpenDyslexic font) vs "ADHD Mode" (Focus ruler).
*   **Clinical Basis:** Inspired by proven Optometric Vision Therapy techniques.

## Slide 6: Technical Architecture (How We Built It)
**[Visual Outline]:** Architecture Diagram showing "Client-Side Only" flow.
**[Bullet Points]:**
*   **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite (Optimized for high-performance rendering).
*   **ML Engine:** TensorFlow.js backend (WASM acceleration) + MediaPipe Vision.
*   **State Management:** React Context API for global accessibility settings.
*   **Performance:** Achieved stable 60 FPS tracking on standard non-GPU laptops.
*   **Zero-Lag:** Processing happens within 16ms per frame (real-time feedback).

## Slide 7: Impact & Feasibility
**[Visual Outline]:** Icons for Schools, Corporate Offices, and Revenue Chart.
**[Bullet Points]:**
*   **EdTech Revolution:** Helping schools meet IDEA / ADA accessibility compliance efficiently.
*   **Corporate ROI:** Boosting productivity for the neurodiverse workforce (huge untapped talent).
*   **Scalability:** Cost of goods sold is ~0 (Client-side compute). Can scale to millions instantly.
*   **Social Good:** Democratizing access to "Vision Therapy" tools that usually cost thousands.
*   **Current Status:** Live, deployed, and tested with real users.

## Slide 8: Conclusion & Future Roadmap
**[Visual Outline]:** QR Code to the Vercel link. "Try it Live".
**[Bullet Points]:**
*   **Immediate Next Steps:** Mobile App (React Native) + Chrome Extension (for browsing web).
*   **Phase 2:** "Eye-Typing" for motor-impaired users.
*   **Phase 3:** Integrating LLMs (Gemini) for "Context-Aware" summarization.
*   **Closing:** Privacy-first, AI-driven, and Live *Right Now*.
*   **Call to Action:** Scan to try the prototype: `lock-focus-hackathon.vercel.app`
