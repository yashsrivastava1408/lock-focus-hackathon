# 🎯 Lock Focus: Round 2 Presentation Outline

**Theme:** Neurodiversity & Accessibility
**Tagline:** Adaptive Reading, Reimagined.
**Time Limit:** Typically 3-5 Minutes.

---

## 1. Title Slide
*   **Headline:** Lock Focus
*   **Sub-headline:** An Intent-Aware Cognitive Interface for Neurodiverse Minds.
*   **Visual:** Hero Section of your Project Page (with "Cognitive Load: Optimal" badge).
*   **Team Name:** [Your Team Name]
*   **Context:** National Hackathon Round 2 Prototype.

## 2. The Problem: "One Size Fits None"
*   **Hook:** 20% of the world is neurodiverse (ADHD, Dyslexia), yet digital interfaces are rigid and static.
*   **Pain Points:**
    *   **Cognitive Overload:** Walls of text cause immediate fatigue.
    *   **Focus Drifts:** A static screen cannot detect when a user stops paying attention.
    *   **Accessibility Friction:** Medical diagnosis is expensive; support should be universal.
*   **The Gap:** Current tools are "Settings Menus" (manual), not "Agents" (automatic).

---

## 3. The Solution: Lock Focus
*   **Definition:** A web platform that *watches* how you read and *adapts* the content in real-time to match your cognitive state.
*   **Core Philosophy:** "The Interface Molds to the User."
*   **Key Innovation:** **Privacy-First Intent Detection** (Zero data leaves the device).

---

## 4. Feature 1: Neuro-Pilot (The "AI" Hook)
*   **What it is:** Camera-based attention steering.
*   **How it works:** Uses MediaPipe Iris Tracking to detect gaze.
*   **The Magic:** If you look away, the text pauses/blurs. When you focus back, it resumes.
*   **Why it matters:** It acts like a "Spotter" in the gym, gently nudging you back to focus.

---

## 5. Feature 2: PeriQuest (The "Gamification" Hook)
*   **What it is:** A Peripheral Vision Training Game.
*   **Target:** Users with Dyslexia/Narrow visual span.
*   **Mechanism:** React-based implementation of clinical visual expansion exercises.
*   **Tech Flex:** Real-time canvas rendering + Eye Tracking input.

---

## 6. Feature 3: Adaptive Reader (The "Utility" Hook)
*   **What it is:** PDF Transformation Engine.
*   **Function:** Upload ANY dense PDF -> Convert to "Bionic Reading" / Dyslexia-friendly format Instantly.
*   **Accessibility:** Includes "Syllable Slasher" for decoding training.

---

## 7. Under the Hood (Tech Stack)
*   **Frontend:** React + Vite (Fast, Responsive).
*   **AI/ML:** TensorFlow.js + MediaPipe (Running locally in browser).
*   **Privacy:** **100% Client-Side.** No video feed is ever sent to a server.
*   **Deployment:** Vercel (Edge Network).

---

## 8. Impact & Feasibility
*   **Scalability:** Since it runs on client devices, it costs near zero to scale to millions of users.
*   **Market:** Education (Schools), Corporate (Workforce productivity), Clinical (Therapy supplement).
*   **Current Status:** **Live Prototype** with 4 working modules.
