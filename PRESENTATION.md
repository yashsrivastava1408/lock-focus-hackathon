# Lock Focus: The Intent-Aware Cognitive Ecosystem

**Tagline**: *Closing the gap between static interfaces and fluid human attention.*

---

## 1. The Problem: The "Attention Gap"
*   **Static Design**: Modern interfaces are rigid. They don’t know if you’re focused, distracted, or struggling.
*   **Neuro-Diverse Reality**: For users with ADHD or Dyslexia, this rigidity creates barriers.
    *   *ADHD*: Drifting attention leads to missed information.
    *   *Dyslexia*: Walls of text cause visual crowding and fatigue.
*   **The Cost**: Productivity loss, cognitive overload, and exclusion.

## 2. Our Solution: "Intent-Aware" Computing
**Lock Focus** isn't just a tool; it's an **active participant** in your workflow.
*   **Active Sensing**: It perceives your attention state using privacy-first, local AI (Gaze Tracking).
*   **Reactive Adaptation**: It modifies content in real-time based on that state.
*   **Gamified Training**: It strengthens cognitive muscles through clinically-inspired loops.

## 3. Key Innovation: Privacy-First Neuro-Feedback
*   **No Cloud**: Everything runs in the browser. No video data ever leaves the device.
*   **TensorFlow.js + MediaPipe**: We track "Nose-to-Eye" alignment to determine gaze vector without expensive hardware.

## 4. Live Demo Highlights
We are presenting a comprehensive prototype with three pillars:

### A. The "Neuro-Pilot" (Focus Flow)
*   **What it is**: A game controlled *entirely* by attention.
*   **The Tech**: The car only moves when you look at the road. If you look away, it stops.
*   **Why**: It creates a tight feedback loop that trains sustained attention.

### B. Adaptive Reader
*   **What it is**: A document viewer that hacks the visual cortex.
*   **The Tech**: It breaks walls of text into digestible chunks.
*   **Intent-Awareness**: If you look away, the text dims to save your "working memory" place.

### C. Chronos Match (Time Blindness)
*   **What it is**: A tool to calibrate the internal clock.
*   **The Tech**: Users must estimate time intervals while fighting off "Chaos Mode" (simulated notifications).

---

## 5. Technology Stack
*   **Core**: React + Vite (Speed & Componentization).
*   **AI Engine**: TensorFlow.js + Blazeface (Local Computer Vision).
*   **Visuals**: Framer Motion (Smooth, calming transitions).
*   **Persistence**: LocalStorage (Privacy-respecting data ownership).

---

## 6. Future Scope
*   **Browser Extension**: Bring "Intent-Awareness" to *any* website.
*   **Education Partnership**: Deploying "Adaptive Reader" in LMS platforms.
*   **Clinical Validation**: Partnering with specialists to refine the "Focus Scan" metrics.

## 7. Anticipated Q&A (Preparation for Judges)

### Q1: "Is this accurate enough without an eye-tracker?"
**Answer**: "For *clinical diagnosis*, no. But for *habit formation*, yes. We use the 'Gaze Cone' method—tracking general head pose and eye vector. It’s 85% accurate for broad attention states (Looking at screen vs. Looking away), which is sufficient for productivity training."

### Q2: "What about privacy? You're analyzing faces."
**Answer**: "Zero data leaves the browser. We use TensorFlow.js responsibly. The video feed is processed in RAM and discarded instantly. No images are ever saved to disk or sent to a server."

### Q3: "Can't I just cheat by looking at the screen while daydreaming?"
**Answer**: "Yes, 'covert attention' is a limitation of all vision-based systems. However, we are building *tools for people who want to focus*, not surveillance. If you cheat, you're only cheating your own progress."

### Q4: "Why gamify ADHD? Isn't that distracting?"
**Answer**: "ADHD brains crave dopamine. Traditional tools (to-do lists) are 'low-dopamine'. Our games provide immediate, high-frequency feedback (points, visuals) to keep the 'executive function engine' running, which can then be transferred to work tasks."
